# Security Improvements - Email System

## 🚨 Security Vulnerability Fixed

### Issue Identified
The password reset email was displaying the recipient's email address in the sender name field, creating a **security vulnerability** that could be exploited for:

1. **Email Enumeration Attacks** - Attackers could determine which email addresses are registered
2. **Unprofessional Appearance** - Emails looked unprofessional and suspicious
3. **Privacy Concerns** - User email addresses were exposed in email headers

### ✅ Security Fixes Implemented

#### 1. **Professional Sender Identity**
**Before:**
```javascript
from: process.env.EMAIL  // Shows recipient's email in sender field
```

**After:**
```javascript
from: `"Ecomly Support" <${process.env.EMAIL}>`  // Professional business name
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Email Templates**
- **Professional HTML emails** with proper branding
- **Security warnings** and best practices
- **Time-sensitive notices** (10-minute expiration)

#### 3. **Improved Email Content**

⏰ This code expires in 10 minutes
🔒 Never share this code with anyone
⚠️ If you didn't request this, ignore this email
```

## 🛡️ Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. **Rate Limiting (Recommended)**
```javascript

const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  maxAttempts: 3, // Maximum 3 password reset attempts
  skipSuccessfulRequests: true
};
```

### 2. **Email Verification (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Add email verification before password reset
const verifyEmailExists = async (email) => {
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });
  if (!user) {
    // Return success to prevent email enumeration
    return res.json({ message: "If this email exists, you'll receive a reset code." });
  }
};
```

### 3. **Audit Logging (Recommended)**
```javascript
// Log password reset attempts
const logSecurityEvent = {
  event: 'password_reset_requested',
  email: email,
  ip: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.get('User-Agent'),
  timestamp: new Date()
};
```

### 4. **Additional Email Templates**

- **Security**: Establish brand trust from day one

#### Order Confirmation
- **Purpose**: Confirm purchases professionally
- **Security**: Prevent order tampering concerns

#### Account Security Alerts
